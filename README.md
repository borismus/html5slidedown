# What is it?

A starting point for all of Boris' presentations.

Based entirely on http://code.google.com/p/html5slides/, with added
markdown support via Showdown.

To write a slide in markdown, do the following:

    <article data-markdown>
    ...markdown stuff here...
    </article>

TODO:

* Make it possible to pre-process, so that the markdown gets HTMLified
  statically.
